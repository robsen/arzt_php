# arzt_php
Preparation for the final apprenticeship exam in plain PHP.

With the ultimate goal to write this application just from memory without any help of documentation and google.
95% of this code is written from memory.

I made the final apprenticeship exam successfully. :)

Just an example web-application for managing patients in a doctor's office.
Completely incomplete.
